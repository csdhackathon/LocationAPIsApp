### Sample App showcasing consumption of [Pitney Bowes Location Intelligence APIs](http://www.pitneybowes.com/us/developer/geocoding-apis.html)

### Use Case
Targeted Marketing to nearby customers

### Description
All address of the dayâ€™s shipments can be used to find out which addresses fall within a travel boundary (drive time) of 60 minutes. These customers can be sent out promotional leaflets for example, offering them same day delivery if they order before noon and ship to the same address. The shortlisted addresses along with customer name, can be fed into a marketing template and sent to printer connected to SendPro machine. These promotional leaflets can be sent along with the actual shipment.
